# Darwin's World

## Description
"Darwin's World" is a simulation project that explores the dynamics of an artificial ecosystem. It features virtual creatures navigating a world, making decisions, and evolving over time. The project is designed to model behaviors seen in natural systems and provide insights into the factors that influence survival and reproduction in a controlled virtual environment.

## Features
- Simulation of an ecosystem with multiple species.
- Creatures with behaviors governed by customizable rules.
- Evolutionary dynamics allowing creatures to adapt over generations.

## Technologies Used
- Java

## Installation
To run "Darwin's World", follow these steps:
1. Clone the repository to your local machine.
2. Ensure you have Java installed; you can download it from [Oracle's Java site](https://www.oracle.com/java/technologies/javase-jdk11-downloads.html).
3. Compile the Java files in your preferred IDE or using the Java command line tools.
4. Run the main class `DarwinsWorld.java` to start the simulation.

## Usage
After running the simulation, observe how creatures interact and evolve within the environment. Adjust parameters in the code to see how different conditions affect the ecosystem.
